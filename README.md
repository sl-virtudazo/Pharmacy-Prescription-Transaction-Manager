**PHARMACY PRESCRIPTION TRANSACTION MANAGER**

The Pharmacy Prescription Transaction Manager is a Java console and GUI system that simplifies pharmacy transactions, from recording prescriptions to generating receipts. It’s built with Java Swing, HashMap, and File I/O for quick access, organized storage, and smooth processing. This project focuses on improving accuracy and speed in pharmacy operations while reducing manual errors. It’s a clean, simple prototype that shows how data structures and object-oriented programming can make real-world processes more efficient.
