**💊 PHARMACY PRESCRIPTION TRANSACTION MANAGER**

The Pharmacy Prescription Transaction Manager is a Java-based system that helps make pharmacy transactions faster and more organized. It manages prescriptions, billing, and patient records through an easy-to-use graphical interface built with Java Swing and JOptionPane. The system uses HashMap and hashing for quick data access and Java File I/O for safe data storage. Its main goal is to improve accuracy, reduce manual errors, and ensure efficient processing in pharmacy operations. Overall, it serves as a simple and functional prototype that applies data structures and object-oriented programming to real-world pharmacy management.

**🖥️ HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:**

**📌 Option 1:** Running the project via Command Line

	1. Ensure you have Java JDK 8 or higher installed on your computer.
	2. Open command prompt or terminal and go to your project directory: cd [project-folder-name]/src
	2. Compile all Java source files: javac *.java
	3. Run the main program file (make sure it contains the main method): java PharmacyManagerSystem
	4. Make sure PharmacyManagerSystem.java contains the main method
	5. Follow the on-screen instructions displayed in the console to:
		- Add patients
		- Search prescriptions
		- Confirm transactions
		- Generate receipts
		
**📌 Option 2:** Run Using an IDE

	1. Open your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)
	2. Import or open the project folder: [project-folder-name]
	3. Locate and open the main file: PharmacyManagerSystem.java
	4. Click the “Run or ▶️” button or press Shift + F10
	5. The program will launch in the IDE’s console window, allowing you to interact with it
	
**📌 Option 3:** Run from a JAR File

	If you have exported the program into a '.jar file' (example, 'PharmacyManagerSystem.jar'), you can run it using the command below:

	java -jar PharmacyManagerSystem.jar

**🗎 REVISIONS**

We made minor revisions both to our system and documentation to better demonstrate our algorithmic improvements:

1. In the Results and Discussion section, we added a baseline comparison from an existing study. The statement reads: “Consequently, the system demonstrates a marked improvement in transaction speed and accuracy, effectively mitigating the inefficiencies inherent in sequential search methods with O(n) complexity typical of manual processes.” This addition highlights how similar systems transition from a linear search approach to a hashing algorithm.
   
2. We also included a comparison table and sample code in the same section to directly compare the existing method to our implementation, clearly highlighting the complexity differences and performance improvements achieved by our system.
